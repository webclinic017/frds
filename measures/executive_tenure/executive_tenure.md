# Executive Tenure

## Definition

Executive tenure is computed based on the data from `EXECCOMP.ANNCOMP`. Specifically, the first appearance of an executive in a firm marks the start of the tenure. Subsequent appearance of the executive in the annual compensation dataset increments the executive's tenure accordingly.
